# tutorial-C-embedded  
##Description
This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from a course I attended at FPT Software, focused on C programming and embedded systems development. The code here was written by me as part of my learning process and demonstrates various concepts in embedded programming.  

##Note
These exercises were inspired by assignments provided in the FPT Software training program. However, this repository only contains my original code implementations without including specific content or descriptions from the original assignments to respect FPT Software's intellectual property rights.
