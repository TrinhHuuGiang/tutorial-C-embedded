# Tutorial C/Embedded

## Description  
This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from a course I attended at FPT Software, focused on C programming and embedded systems development, including work with the KE16 microcontroller. The code here demonstrates various concepts such as GPIO handling, interrupts, and timer configuration, all of which were part of my learning process in embedded programming.  

## Note  
These exercises were inspired by assignments provided in the FPT Software training program. However, this repository only contains my original code implementations without including specific content or descriptions from the original assignments to respect FPT Software's intellectual property rights.

## Requirements
**Visual Studio Code**  
**MCUXpresso**: Essential toolchain for developing for NXP microcontrollers, including the KE16 series.  
**NXP KE16 Board**: Target microcontroller board used for deploying and testing.
